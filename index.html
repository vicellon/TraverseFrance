                    To experience Paris at it’s most enchanting, visit the Eiffel Tower during the sunset. The way the early evening lights glow and illuminate the buildings below almost puts a spell over the city, giving it the most romantic setting.

                <div>
                    The higher you go, the more spectacular the city appears as the sun goes down. The way the city’s monuments and the Seine River reflect the golden rays of the sun will give you goosebumps. And as an extra touch, the Eiffel Tower is fitted with glittering lights that sparkle for a few minutes every hour.

                    A truly memory drilling experience is to watch the sunset as you dine from one of the restaurant on the Eiffel Tower: Madame Brasserie, a comtemporary brasserie on the first level that offers a seasonal menu, or the Le Jules gastronomic restaurant on the second level that serves Michelin-Star quality French cuisine.

                    Even the main entrance way to the Musee de Louvre is an artistic dream, as is befitting to the world's most visited museum. But there's not much time to linger gazing up at the glassy pyramid.

                    For inside awaits the fantasy of the most ethereal collection of art the world has seen, with everything from the Code of Hammurabi, to Egyptian mummies, to Leonardo's Mona Lisa, and the Venus de Milo.                
                </div>
                <div>
                    The museum has endured the centuries-old political and social transformations of France, while still maintaining the vastness and beauty of the human mind under a single roof, and thereby becoming a potent symbolization of French finesse and sensitivity.
